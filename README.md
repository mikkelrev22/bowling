# Bowling :bowling:
___
## Purpose
- creating app to simulate bowling scoring
___
## What happens?
- a user clicks a button to "bowl"
- after each click, the "bowl" score is added to the scoreboard
- the game is scored and ends in the same way a normal game of bowling would be scored and end
___
## What I learned?
- how to use React Hooks, specifically the useState & useEffect hooks
- deep copies of matrices are necessary when you are changing elements in the rows; you cannot just rely upon your usual destructuring
- I need to improve on DRY & separation of concerns (helper functions); my code is too repetetive and unclear and the functions are too bulky
- how to use CSS grid
- do not be afraid to store multiple fields of data in state; if something ends up being unnessary, it is probably easy to get rid of it
___
## To Do
- clean up code
- mobile compatibility?
- deploy to the cloud
